For as long as humans have existed, we have used materials around us in creative ways to enhance our lives. In ancient times, these materials included ceramics, lime plasters, pigments, and charcoals. In modern life, we use high-tech materials in everything from medical implants (biomaterials) to data storage and retrieval (magnetic materials) to sensors (electronic materials). Then and now, many factors affect the performance of a material, including its
composition and the amount of structural order that is introduced during its preparation and use. Therefore, experiments that investigate how structural order affects the magnetic, optical, electronic, or mechanical properties of solid materials are very important from scientific, technological, and cultural standpoints.</p>

<TD width="*"  align="left" valign="center" >  Coatings that mimic the composition of natural biomaterials
have a wide range of potential medical applications. For example, hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) is a compound that has been studied extensively because of its resemblance to the mineral phase in bone. Adding collagen or other proteins to mineral coatings to form a bioinorganic composite material can increase the biocompatibility of the coating. <a href="?content=pubs&topic=research">We use electrochemical methods to make mineral films and collagen membranes, and we study the mineral-protein symbiosis involved in making biocomposite coatings.</a> <br><br> Collaborators: <a href="http://www.chem.mun.ca/~erika">Dr. Erika Merschrod</a>, Memorial Chemistry, <a href="http://www.med.mun.ca/Medicine/Faculty/Gendron,-Robert.aspx">Dr. Bob Gendron</a> and  <a href="http://www.med.mun.ca/Medicine/Faculty/Paradis,-Helene.aspx">Dr. Helene Paradis</a>, Memorial Medicine, <a href="http://www.upei.ca/healthmgt/lmcduffee">Dr. Laurie McDuffee</a>, Atlantic Veterinary College and University of Prince Edward Island</TD>

explored extensively to study the fundamental properties of crystallization and as a means to create photonic band gap crystals, optical sensors and antireflection coatings. Their periodic lattices can also serve as a template to make magnetic patterns, with potential applications as magnetic memory storage materials. <a href="?content=pubs&topic=research">We employ electrochemical methods to produce magnetic materials, and we investigate how templates can be used to confine their growth and affect their local and long-range magnetic properties.</a> <br><br> Collaborators: <a href="http://www.physics.mun.ca/~anand">Dr. Anand Yethiraj</a> and <a href="http://www.physics.mun.ca/~plumer">Dr. Martin Plumer</a>, Memorial Physics
