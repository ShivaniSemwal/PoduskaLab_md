<h2>Prospective graduate students in physics,
chemistry, or environmental science </h2>



Admission to graduate student positions in the Poduska group is competitive. I give preference to students with evidence of research potential (including curiosity, previous project work, independence, and initiative). <br><br>

There are no new openings available for students in my group at the present time. Due to the large number of inquiries that I receive, I may not be able to reply to all email requests from potential students. However, I encourage potential graduate students at the M.Sc. or Ph.D. level to apply directly to the program that best matches their coursework background: <a href="https://www.mun.ca/become/graduate/programs-and-courses/physics-and-physical-oceanography/">
Physics and Physical Oceanography</a>, <a href="https://www.mun.ca/become/graduate/programs-and-courses/chemistry/">
Chemistry</a>, or the interdisciplinary <a href="http://www.mun.ca/science/graduate/interdisciplinary/envs/">Environmental Science Program</a>. <i><b>Please note that you do not need to indicate a supervisor before you apply.</b></i> 


<h2>Undergraduates seeking Honours degrees in physics and/or chemistry </h2>
I offer a range of experimental and computational Honours thesis topics related to the physics and chemistry of materials. Please contact me by e-mail (kris_at_mun.ca) for more details.

<h2>Undergraduates involved in physics, chemistry, or engineering</h2>

40-hour per term positions are available for the Summer 2023, Fall 2023, and Winter 2024 academic terms (apply directly through <a href="https://www.mun.ca/student/career-services/build-work-experience/work-on-campus/">Memorial's Undergraduate Career Experience Program and International Student Work Experience Program</a> during the first week of classes each term).<P>

<p>Many undergraduates have also worked in my research group with funding through national programs (such as <a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/UG-PC/index_eng.asp">NSERC Undergraduate Summer Research Awards</a>. I encourage interested undergraduate students to contact me by e-mail (kris_at_mun.ca) to learn more.
