<h2>Course information </h2>

Attention all undergraduates! PHYS 3900 is unlike any other physics course you've taken, and we're proud of that. In this course, you work closely with instructors on several different special projects of your choice from areas like optics, materials science, spectroscopy, fluids, and modern physics. Not only do you learn some cool physics, but you also develop marketable practical skill in the process. What does this mean for you? By the end of the term, your instructors can help you build a list of resume-appropriate skills to showcase what you've learned. This will help you when you apply for jobs, and it will also help your instructors to write more detailed recommendation letters for you when you need them in the future.

<li><strong>Text:</strong> none

<li><strong>Classes:</strong> Section 001 meets M,W 14:00-15:15 in C4044, with the first class meeting on Monday, 08 January 2018. </li>

<li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> at least two of: PHYS 2053 (Fluids and Thermodynamics), 2820 (Computational Mechanics), 2055 (Electricity and Magnetism), and PHYS 2750/2056 (Modern Physics)</li>

<li><strong>Topics:</strong>  PHYS 3900 develops experimental, analytical, and communications skills through extended experiments in fields of physics including optics, magnetism, fluids, spectroscopy, materials characterization, and modern physics. Students select from a range of experiments that illustrate concepts encountered in previous courses to apply existing knowledge and problem solving skills, while other experiments introduce more advanced techniques and phenomena.
