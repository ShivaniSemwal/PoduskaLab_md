For as long as humans have existed, we have used materials around us in creative ways to enhance our lives. It is critically important to understand how such materials change as they are produced, used, and stored. Not only can this improve the performance and lifetime of technological materials, but it is also an essential part of improving sustainability and developing effective strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change. The methodologies that we use are relevant for biominerals, geological minerals, lab-produced materials, as well as ancient archaeological materials.<p>
