<strong>Fall 2018</strong>

<h2>Course information </h2>

Candidates for the Honours B. Sc. degree in physics are required to submit a written thesis based on their own research carried out under the supervision of a faculty member. The purpose of writing a thesis is to provide an opportunity to pursue a project in depth outside the usual constraints of course work.  The project gives a taste of independent research, including gaining familiarity with scientific literature, organizing and analyzing results, and communicating the results clearly to make the research accessible to others.
